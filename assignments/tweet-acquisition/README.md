 
1. Tweets are organized in json files in the following bucket s3://cloofa-ds205/assignment2/

I was not certain if the question wanted the 2 terms both together in a tweet (and),  or either one of them (or).  I assumed the latter just because the returned set of tweets would be larger so my query was:
"#minecraft OR #mojang"
